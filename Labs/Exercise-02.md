# Lab 02: Building and Customizing Prompt Flows

### Estimated Duration: 90 Minutes

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you will gain hands-on experience in initializing a Prompt Flow project in Azure AI Foundry, setting up the necessary environment to begin developing, testing, and refining AI applications. You will create and customize prompts within Azure AI Foundry's Prompt Flow. Starting with the creation of a new flow, you will add and configure the Prompt tool and develop a flow incorporating LLM (Large Language Model) and Prompt tools. By authoring a sample flow and running it with custom inputs, you'll learn how to monitor flow execution and evaluate outputs, thereby understanding the practical steps involved in developing, testing, and refining AI-driven workflows.

## Lab Objectives
In this lab, you will perform the following:

- Task 1: Initialize a Prompt Flow Project
- Task 2: Create and Customize Prompts
- Task 3: Develop a Flow with LLM and Prompt Tools

## Task 1: Initialize a Prompt Flow Project

In this task, you will set up a structured environment to manage and streamline prompt-based AI tasks. This involves creating a project directory, configuring essential files and dependencies, and establishing a workflow for designing, testing, and refining prompts. Organizing prompts, data, and evaluation metrics in one place ensures consistency and efficiency, helping you optimize prompt performance and achieve better results with your AI models.

### Task 2: Create and Customize Prompts

In this task, you will focus on creating and customizing prompts by designing targeted and purposeful questions or statements that guide the LLM toward generating accurate and useful responses. You'll define clear objectives, consider the intended audience, and use precise language to ensure relevance. Customization will help align prompts with specific contexts or use cases, improving engagement and effectiveness in applications like education, customer support, and AI-driven workflows.

1. From the left navigation menu, under **My assets**, select **Model + endpoints (1)**.

### Task 3: Develop a Flow with LLM and Prompt Tools

In this task, you will develop a flow with Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt tools by defining a clear objective, selecting the appropriate LLM, and crafting structured prompts to guide the model’s responses. You will iteratively refine these prompts based on the output to ensure accuracy and relevance. Prompt tools will help you manage and optimize the interaction, enabling efficient use of LLMs for tasks such as content creation, data analysis, or automated support.

1. The prompt flow authoring page opens. You can start authoring your flow now. By default, you see a sample flow. This example flow has nodes for the LLM and Python tools.

1. Optionally, you can add more tools to the flow. The visible tool options are **LLM, Prompt, and Python**. To view more tools, select **+ More tools**.

    ![](./media/4-7-25-l2-13.png)

1. From the **Graph**, select **joke (1)**. Choose an existing connection **ai-modelhub<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>_aoai (2)** from the drop-down menu, and for deployment, select the newly created deployment, **gpt-4o (3)**, in the LLM tool editor.
