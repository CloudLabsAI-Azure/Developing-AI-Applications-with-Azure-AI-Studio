# Lab 04: Fine-Tuning Prompts for Optimal Performance

### Estimated Duration: 120 Minutes

## Lab Overview
In this hands-on lab, you will explore fine-tuning prompts for optimal performance, learning how to craft precise and effective input queries that maximize the accuracy, relevance, and efficiency of AI-generated responses. You will experiment with structuring prompts to guide AI behavior, incorporating context, constraints, and desired output formats to achieve more consistent results. By iterating on prompt design and analyzing AI responses, you will develop best practices for refining inputs to suit various use cases, from summarization and data extraction to creative writing and technical problem-solving.
 
## Lab Objectives
In this lab, you will perform the following:
- Task 1: Perform Iterative Prompt Tuning and Variant Comparison
- Task 2: Optimize Flow Performance for Production

## Task 1: Perform Iterative Prompt Tuning and Variant Comparison 

In this task, you will refine model responses by adjusting prompts over successive iterations. This process enables systematic evaluation and comparison of output variants, helping to ensure that each iteration leads to improved performance and more accurate, relevant responses.

   # system:
   Your task is to classify a given URL into one of the following categories:
   Movie, App, Academic, Channel, Profile, PDF, or None based on the text content information.
   The classification must be based on the URL, the webpage text content summary, or both.
   
   # user:
   The "category" must be one of: Movie, App, Academic, Channel, Profile, PDF,News,Shopping or None.
   The "evidence" must be one of: Url, Text content, or Both.
   
   For a given URL and text content, classify the URL into the appropriate category and indicate the evidence used for classification.
   
   Here are a few examples:
   {% for ex in examples %}
   URL: {{ex.url}}
   Text content: {{ex.text_content}}
   
   OUTPUT:
   Use this exact JSON format for your output (no extra text, prefixes, or suffixes):
   {"category": "{{ex.category }}", "evidence": "{{ex.evidence}}"}

   {%  endfor %}

   For a given URL and text content, classify the url to complete the category and indicate evidence:
   URL: {{url}}
   Text content: {{text_content}}
   OUTPUT:
   ```

    Use the URL string, the summary of the page content, or both to decide the most appropriate category.
    
    # user:
    The selection range of the value of "category" must be "Movie",  "App", " Academic",  "Channel",  "Profile" , "PDF", "News", "Shopping" or "None".
    The selection range of the value of "evidence" must be within Url, Text content, or Both â€” depending on what was most helpful in making your classification.
    Given the input below, classify the link and return your answer strictly in valid JSON format.
    Here are a few examples:
    {% for ex in examples %}
    URL: {{ex.url}}

   Text: The history of the internet dates back to the early 1960s, when the idea of a global network of computers was first proposed. In the late 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects 
   Agency Network (ARPANET) was developed by the United States Department of Defense. It was the first operational packet-switching network and the precursor to the modern internet. The 
   1970s and 1980s saw the development of various protocols and standards, such as TCP/IP, which allowed different networks to communicate with each other. In the 1990s, the invention 
   of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee revolutionized the internet, making it accessible to the general public. Since then, the internet has grown exponentially, becoming an 
   integral part of daily life for billions of people around the world.

   Text: Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. AI has various applications in today's society, 
   including robotics, natural language processing, and decision-making systems. AI can be categorized into narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, and general AI, which can 
   perform any intellectual task that a human can. Despite its benefits, AI also poses ethical concerns, such as privacy invasion and job displacement.
