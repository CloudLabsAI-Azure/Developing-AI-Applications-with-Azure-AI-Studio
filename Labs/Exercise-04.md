# Lab 04: Fine-Tuning the Model 

## Lab scenario
In this lab, you will be fine-tuning a model by performing iterative prompt tuning and variant comparison to enhance its performance and accuracy. You will leverage Azure AI Studio to systematically refine prompts, evaluate different model variants, and determine the best configurations. Additionally, you will optimize the flow performance for production, ensuring that the workflow processes are efficient and effective. This will involve identifying and addressing bottlenecks, implementing best practices, and leveraging advanced tools to improve overall productivity and operational efficiency.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will perform the following:
- Task 1: Perform Iterative Prompt Tuning and Variant Comparison
- Task 2: Optimize Flow Performance for Production

## Task 1: Perform Iterative Prompt Tuning and Variant Comparison 
It refine model responses by adjusting prompts in successive iterations. This process allows for systematic evaluation of the differences between output variants, ensuring that the model's performance improves with each iteration and produces the most accurate and relevant responses.

   Text: The history of the internet dates back to the early 1960s, when the idea of a global network of computers was first proposed. In the late 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects 
   Agency Network (ARPANET) was developed by the United States Department of Defense. It was the first operational packet-switching network and the precursor to the modern internet. The 
   1970s and 1980s saw the development of various protocols and standards, such as TCP/IP, which allowed different networks to communicate with each other. In the 1990s, the invention 
   of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee revolutionized the internet, making it accessible to the general public. Since then, the internet has grown exponentially, becoming an 
   integral part of daily life for billions of people around the world.

   Text: Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. AI has various applications in today's society, 
   including robotics, natural language processing, and decision-making systems. AI can be categorized into narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, and general AI, which can 
   perform any intellectual task that a human can. Despite its benefits, AI also poses ethical concerns, such as privacy invasion and job displacement.
